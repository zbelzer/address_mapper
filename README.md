An application built to learn the basics of Backbone, integrate it with a basic
rails server and to connect to an external service.

This is the culmination of about 6 hours of effort, which includes time
relearning some nuances of JavaScript and the basics of Backbone. Since I was
already coming up the learning curve on Backbone and because proficiency with
JavaScript wasn't the main purpose of this exercise, I chose not to write
JavaScript tests.

This app is hosted on heroku: http://address-mapper.herokuapp.com/
